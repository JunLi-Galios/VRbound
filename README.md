# Vatiational Renyi Bound

Thank you for your interest in our paper:

[Yingzhen Li](http://yingzhenli.net/home/en/) and 
[Richard E. Turner](http://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/WebHome)

[Renyi Divergence Variational Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02311)

Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2016

Please consider citing the paper when any of the material is used for your
research.

You will find the paper tex files, variational auto-encoder examples 
(implemented with numpy, autograd, and a modification of [IWAE](https://github.com/yburda/iwae) 
code), and a black-box implementation of Bayesian neural network here.

A tensorflow implementation for the variational auto-encoder with Renyi
Divergence can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/YingzhenLi/vae_renyi_divergence).
